### üîê **Secure Authentication System**
- **Lock page** that completely blocks access to the AI chat
- **5-minute session timeout** for security
- **Beautiful login interface** with your branding
- **Session timer** showing remaining time

### üìä **Multi-Sheet Google Sheets Integration**

## üîë **CRITICAL: Your Passcode**

**Your app is now secured with the passcode: `ara2024voice`**

You can change this by setting the `SECRET_PHRASE` environment variable in Render.

## üìã **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Update Your Repository**
```bash
cd ara-voice
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Multi-Sheet Google Apps Script**

1. **Go to Google Apps Script**: https://script.google.com/
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Delete the default code**
4. **Copy and paste the complete code from `Multi-Sheet-Code.gs`** (I've created this file for you)
5. **Save the project** (name it "Ara Voice Multi-Sheet API")

### **Step 3: Configure Your Sheet IDs**

In the Google Apps Script, update the `SHEET_IDS` array with your sheet IDs:

```javascript
const SHEET_IDS = [
  '1CwV3uJ_fgs783230SQXvZs5kRGFFNmeaYRYYTT-yvkQ',  // Your first sheet
  '1aAb6jKRxisGKVQIex_HU59lX6X-Kkm4tTIH7qXfaEW0',  // Your second sheet
  '1RIXQIyGZ9qfW3x3JdpwfBIMmoNf-r9zH7ffjk5jeYks',  // Your third sheet
  '1tGcU53sMpzuGrU3tDUilyj0KACnsjEfFY0t_5eW4pZM',  // Your fourth sheet
  '1dElu39ly3LNHAMZupg1OzWmAmoDZVMRWXX5x2ksw12Q'   // Your fifth sheet
];
```

### **Step 4: Deploy the Google Apps Script**

1. **Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"**
2. **Select "Web app" as type**
3. **Set "Execute as": Me (your-email@gmail.com)**
4. **Set "Who has access": Anyone**
5. **Click "Deploy"**
6. **Copy the Web App URL** (ends with `/exec`)

### **Step 5: Update Render Environment Variables**

In your Render dashboard, set these environment variables:

**Required:**
- `SECRET_PHRASE` = `ara2024voice` (or your custom passcode)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` = Your OpenAI API key
- `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` = Your Google Apps Script Web App URL

**Optional:**
- `SESSION_SECRET` = A random secure string
- `USE_MOCK_AI` = `false` (to enable real AI)

### **Step 6: Test Your Setup**

1. **Visit**: https://ara-voice.onrender.com
2. **Enter passcode**: `ara2024voice`
3. **Test commands**:
   - "Add 2 apples to groceries"
   - "Show me my expenses"
   - "Add task: Call dentist"
   - "What's in my shopping list?"

## üéØ **Multi-Sheet Commands You Can Use**

### **Reading Data:**

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Authentication Doesn't Work:**
- Check that `SECRET_PHRASE` is set to `ara2024voice` in Render
- Clear your browser cache and cookies

- Verify your Google Apps Script is deployed as a "Web app"
- Check that the `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in Render matches your deployed script URL
- Ensure the script has permission to access your sheets

### **If Commands Don't Work:**
