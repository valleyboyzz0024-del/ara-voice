# üé§ Ara Voice - The Google Sheets God

**Transform your voice into powerful Google Sheets operations with conversational AI!**

Ara Voice is an intelligent voice-to-Google-Sheets application that understands natural conversation and can perform any requested action in Google Sheets. Speak naturally, and watch as your commands are intelligently processed and executed.

## üöÄ Features

### üß† **Conversational AI Brain**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Speak normally - "add 5 kilos of bananas to my grocery list"
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers conversation history for follow-up commands
- **Intelligent Interpretation**: Infers missing details and provides reasonable defaults
- **Multi-Action Support**: Handles complex operations beyond simple data entry

### üìä **Google Sheets God Mode**
- **addRow**: Add items with smart defaults
- **updateRow**: Modify existing entries by row number
- **deleteRow**: Remove items by position ("delete the last item")
- **findRow**: Search and locate specific entries
- **readSheet**: View entire sheet contents
- **createSheet**: Generate new tabs/worksheets
- **formatCell**: Apply styling and formatting

### üéØ **Smart Command Examples**
```
"Add 2 kilos of apples to my grocery list"
"Delete the last item I added"
"Show me my shopping list" 
"Create a new sheet for work projects"
"Update row 3 with bananas instead"
"Find all entries with 'fruit'"
```

### üîÑ **Backwards Compatible**
- Supports legacy "pickle prince pepsi" command format
- Existing voice recognition interface works unchanged
- Gradual migration path for existing users

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
  -d '{"command":"add 2 bananas to shopping list"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/webhook/voice

# Test with wake phrase
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"pickle prince pepsi add 2 bananas to shopping list"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/webhook/voice

# Test with spoken PIN

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Server Won't Start
**Symptoms**: "GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL environment variable is required"  
**Solution**: Ensure `.env` file exists with correct URL

#### 2. AI Commands Not Working
**Symptoms**: Commands not understood  
**Solutions**:
- Check if OpenAI API key is valid (or rely on mock AI)  
- Verify server logs for processing details
- Try simpler, more direct commands

#### 3. Google Sheets Not Updating
**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check Google Apps Script logs in the Apps Script editor
2. Verify Web App permissions (execute as "Me", access "Anyone")
3. Test the Web App URL directly
4. Check server logs for detailed error messages

#### 4. Conversational Context Issues
**Solutions**:
- Include `sessionId` in requests for conversation continuity
- Clear context by restarting server or using new sessionId
- Check server memory usage for context storage

## üé® Frontend Integration

The enhanced backend is compatible with the existing frontend. The voice recognition interface will automatically benefit from conversational AI processing.

To use conversational commands in your frontend:

```javascript
// New conversational endpoint
fetch('/voice-command', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    command: transcript, // Natural language
    sessionId: userSession // For context
  })
});
```

## üîÆ Advanced Features

### Session Management
- Each user can have their own conversation context
- Commands can reference previous actions
- "Delete what I just added" works across sessions

### AI Fallback
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo when API key provided
- Falls back to pattern-matching mock AI
- Graceful degradation ensures always-working functionality

### Action Routing
- Google Apps Script intelligently routes based on action type
- Extensible architecture for new sheet operations
- Backwards compatible with legacy formats
