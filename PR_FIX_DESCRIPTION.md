# Fix AsyncStorage Dependency Issue

## Problem
The app was failing to launch with the error:
```
Unable to resolve module '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' from 'node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/lib/module/index.js'
```

This was occurring because the database.js file was importing AsyncStorage, but the dependency was not included in package.json.

## Solution
- Added `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` dependency to package.json
- Installed the dependency with npm install

## Testing
- Verified that the app launches without the AsyncStorage error
- Confirmed that database operations work correctly
- Tested on both Android and iOS simulators

## Screenshots
Before:
- App would crash with AsyncStorage resolution error

After:
- App launches successfully
- Database operations work as expected

## Additional Notes
This fix addresses the circular dependency issue with AsyncStorage that was preventing the app from launching. The app now properly initializes the database using AsyncStorage for data persistence.
